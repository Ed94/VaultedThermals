# VT Guide: User Space

This is a the workspace provided for the user as an entry space and used in conjunction with the guides for the user to learn vulkan.

It like the other places in the guides directory have access to the all the dependencies and directories required to build if the setup [specified](https://github.com/Ed94/VaultedThermals/wiki/VT-Guides) was followed.

The only thing defined in the main.cpp is the CrossWindow library header and its associated main function.

[1_Intro](NeedsLink] will give an idea of how to move foward with it.
