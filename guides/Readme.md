There will be a getting started readme that will explain how to setup the guides directory with [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Git will be used within Visual Studio Code, if that is not desired github has a nice [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) on how to get that going.
