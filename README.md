# VaultedThermals
A vulkan wrapper.


This is currently a WIP, I am fleshing this out while making my engine project:
[Abstract Realm](https://github.com/Ed94/AbstractRealm)

Motivations for doing so is like clean libraries and while Vulkan-Hpp looked well designed, I cannot find a proper specification or documentation related to it, only the C-API. There is only their "samples". 

This library aims to have full documentation/specificaton within its comments and have clean organization. 

(Its also to help me learn Vulkan as I wanted to learn a low-level GPU API)

Documentation is currently within the source comments and later on when I get the chance a Doxygen.

The scope of this library is sort of outlined in the VT_Vaults.hpp and VaultedThermals.hpp

My current intentions is to get this going as far as I like in conjunction with following various vulkan guides, and making my engine mvp. After that is done, this will be pubically released with some sort of open source license, and I will most likely stop maintaining it unless I decide to use it for another project.
